## Introduction

### Wang et al. (2018) — 17β-estradiol (E2) promotes growth and stability of new dendritic spines via estrogen receptor β pathway in intact mouse cortex

Recent studies have found that altering levels of estradiol (E2), the most potent estrogen,
can affect neuronal function in several brain regions like the hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex. One potential mechanism is through modulation of dendritic spine density in these 
brain regions, which can impact advanced cognitive functions like learning and memory. 
The objective of this paper is to quantify how E2 treatment can alter the growth and removal 
of these dendritic spines. Additionally, the authors wanted to investigate which of the two 
estrogen receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ, are involved in mediating this process. They used the
ER agonists α-PPT and β-DPN to enhance the activity of ERα and ERβ, respectively.

Their raw data is stratified into two discrete time periods where they observed changes in 
dendritic spines: 0-4 days (d4) and 4-8 days (d8). For some analyses, they used the
combination of these time periods from 0-8 days (dT). The raw data quantifies the total 
number of dendritic spines initially observed (d#_total) and the number of spines that were 
stable, eliminated, or formed after the time period described (d#_stable, d#_elim, d#_form, 
respectively).

The analyses performed by the authors include descriptive statistics for each of the 
parameters described above, including the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of 
the mean. To determine if there were differences between experimental groups, the authors 
employed a t-test. All of their data were graphed as bar graphs.

In this assignment, I will be replicating most of the descriptive statistics that the 
authors performed. Using their data comparing dendritic spine characteristics between the 
control and E2-treated mice, I will redo their t-test and compare it to the authors' 
results. Lastly, I will recreate the three graphs from Figure 2 of their paper.

## Visualization of Data
First, I will load in the raw data files in .xlsx format using the package {readxl}.
```{r}
library(readxl)
file <- "Wang et al. (2018) Raw Data.xlsx"
rawdata <- read_excel(file, sheet = 1, col_names = TRUE)
```
Using `head()` will confirm that the data set was imported into **_R_** correctly. The 
`names()` function is also useful in providing all the header names that will be used in 
subsequent analyses.
``` {r}
head(rawdata)
names(rawdata)
```
Next, I will filter the entire data set based on experimental group using `filter()` from
{dplyr}. This will yield five new tables that can be easily used for comparison of variables 
between experimental groups. Note that the authors of the paper state that the wild-type 1 
(WT1) group is used for comparisons with the E2 group and that the wild-type 2 (WT2) group 
is used to compare with the DPN and PPT groups. 
``` {r}
library(dplyr)
WT1 <- filter(rawdata, rawdata$Exp_Group == "WT1")
E2 <- filter(rawdata, rawdata$Exp_Group == "E2")
WT2 <- filter(rawdata, rawdata$Exp_Group == "WT2")
DPN <- filter(rawdata, rawdata$Exp_Group == "DPN")
PPT <- filter(rawdata, rawdata$Exp_Group == "PPT")
```
Now that I have these filtered data sets, I can draw both basic and more sophisticated 
comparisons between experimental groups. For example, let's compare the means of the total 
dendritic spines (**dT_total**). Other studies have demonstrated that treatment with E2
increases spine density; therefore, I would expect to have a higher value of **dT_total**
in the E2 group compared to the WT1 group. 
```{r}
mean(WT1$dT_total, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(E2$dT_total, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Although I cannot claim statistical significance at this stage of the analysis, it does 
appear that the E2 group has a higher density of dendritic spines compared with WT1. I can
more broadly see an overview of each variable and its five-number summary using the 
`summary()` function. Let's do this with just the **WT1** and **E2** data sets. 
```{r}
summary(WT1)
summary(E2)
```
This output makes it a little difficult to neatly draw comparisons between groups. I can
compare the variable **dT_total** across all experimental groups by using the package
{ggplot2} on the **rawdata** file.
``` {r}
library(ggplot2)
bp_dT_total <- ggplot(data = rawdata, aes(x = Exp_Group, y = dT_total)) + 
  geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0)) + 
  xlab("Experimental Group") + ylab("Total Dendritic Spines")
bp_dT_total
```
Doing these box plots allows for neat visual comparisons between groups and for observing 
the variability within groups. Another method of data exploration includes using the package
{psych} to determine correlations between several variables. I will first use the 
`select()` function of {dplyr} to condense the **rawdata** data set to include variables
looking at dendritic spine characteristics across the 8 day experiment (i.e., **dT_total**,
**dT_stable**, **dT_elim**, and **dT_form**. I will then pass this selected data set through
the `pairs.panels()` function to create the scatter plot matrix of correlation between
variables.
``` {r}
library(psych)
rawdata_select <- select(rawdata, Exp_Group, dT_total, dT_stable, dT_elim, dT_form)
pairs.panels(rawdata_select[],
             smooth = FALSE,
             lm = TRUE,
             method = "pearson",
             hist.col = "#00AFBB",
             density = TRUE,
             ellipses = TRUE
)
```
From this scatter plot matrix, I can that there is a strong, positive correlation (r=0.97) 
between the total amount of dendritic spines and the number of stable, persistent spines.
Now that I have done some exploratory data analysis, I will replicate some of the authors' 
data, repeat their t-tests between experimental groups, and recreate the three graphs from
Figure 2 of their paper.
 
## Replications and Reanalysis
To start, I will first reanalyze the describe statistics in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the
paper. This entails quantifying how E2 treatment affects dendritic spine formation rate,
total quantity of spines, and persistent newly formed spines. First, I will determine 
whether the spine formation rate is different between the WT1 and E2 groups during the 0-4,
4-8, or 0-8 day window. Spine formation rate (SFR) is determined as the number of newly 
formed spines (d#_form) divided by the the total number of spines (d#_total) multiplied by 
100 to obtain the percentage. Below, I calculate the mean and standard error of the mean
(i.e., standard deviation divided by the square root of counts) for the two groups at the
different time points. 
```{r}
print("SFR (Mean ± SEM) for WT Group Between Days 0-4")
(SFRm_WT_4 <- mean(WT1$d4_form / WT1$d4_total, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)
(SFRs_WT_4 <- sd((WT1$d4_form / WT1$d4_total) * 100, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(WT1$d4_form)))
print("SFR (Mean ± SEM) for E2 Group Between Days 0-4")
(SFRm_E2_4 <- mean(E2$d4_form / E2$d4_total, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)
(SFRs_E2_4 <- sd((E2$d4_form / E2$d4_total) * 100, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(E2$d4_form)))

print("SFR (Mean ± SEM) for WT Group Between Days 4-8")
(SFRm_WT_8 <- mean(WT1$d8_form / WT1$d8_total, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)
(SFRs_WT_8 <- sd((WT1$d8_form / WT1$d8_total) * 100, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(WT1$d8_form)))
print("SFR (Mean ± SEM) for E2 Group Between Days 4-8")
(SFRm_E2_8 <- mean(E2$d8_form / E2$d8_total, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)
(SFRs_E2_8 <- sd((E2$d8_form / E2$d8_total) * 100, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(E2$d8_form)))

print("SFR (Mean ± SEM) for WT Group Between Days 0-8")
(SFRm_WT_T <- mean(WT1$dT_form / WT1$dT_total, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)
(SFRs_WT_T <- sd((WT1$dT_form / WT1$dT_total) * 100, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(WT1$dT_form)))
print("SFR (Mean ± SEM) for E2 Group Between Days 0-8")
(SFRm_E2_T <- mean(E2$dT_form / E2$dT_total, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)
(SFRs_E2_T <- sd((E2$dT_form / E2$dT_total) * 100, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(E2$dT_form)))
```
In the paper, the authors state "the spine formation rate increased significantly four days 
after E2 treatment (Fig. 2B; spine formation during days 0–4: control, 4.6 ± 0.6%; E2, 
6.4 ± 0.5%)." My reanalysis of the SFR from the raw data corroborates the authors' 
statement. The mean ± SEM value for SFR_WT_4 and SFR_E2_4 are 4.62 ± 0.58% and 6.44 ± 0.51%,
respectively.

Next, I will compare the total dendritic spine count (TSC) between the WT1 and E2 groups 
across the different time periods. This total spine count is calculated as 100% plus the 
percentage of newly formed spines (d#_form) minus the percentage of eliminated spines 
(d#_elim). I have already calculated the percentage of newly formed spines above, but will 
redo the analysis using the `mutate()` function from {dplyr} instead of just raw
calculations. The additional columns created will be added to a new data set called either
**WT1m** or **E2m**.
``` {r}
WT1m <- mutate(WT1, "SFR_4" = WT1$d4_form / WT1$d4_total * 100)
WT1m <- mutate(WT1m, "SFR_8" = WT1$d8_form / WT1$d8_total * 100)
WT1m <- mutate(WT1m, "SFR_T" = WT1$dT_form / WT1$dT_total * 100)
WT1m <- mutate(WT1m, "SER_4" = WT1$d4_elim / WT1$d4_total * 100)
WT1m <- mutate(WT1m, "SER_8" = WT1$d8_elim / WT1$d8_total * 100)
WT1m <- mutate(WT1m, "SER_T" = WT1$dT_elim / WT1$dT_total * 100)
WT1m <- mutate(WT1m, "TSC_4" = 100 + WT1m$SFR_4 - WT1m$SER_4)
WT1m <- mutate(WT1m, "TSC_8" = 100 + WT1m$SFR_8 - WT1m$SER_8)
WT1m <- mutate(WT1m, "TSC_T" = 100 + WT1m$SFR_T - WT1m$SER_T)

E2m <- mutate(E2, "SFR_4" = E2$d4_form / E2$d4_total * 100)
E2m <- mutate(E2m, "SFR_8" = E2$d8_form / E2$d8_total * 100)
E2m <- mutate(E2m, "SFR_T" = E2$dT_form / E2$dT_total * 100)
E2m <- mutate(E2m, "SER_4" = E2$d4_elim / E2$d4_total * 100)
E2m <- mutate(E2m, "SER_8" = E2$d8_elim / E2$d8_total * 100)
E2m <- mutate(E2m, "SER_T" = E2$dT_elim / E2$dT_total * 100)
E2m <- mutate(E2m, "TSC_4" = 100 + E2m$SFR_4 - E2m$SER_4)
E2m <- mutate(E2m, "TSC_8" = 100 + E2m$SFR_8 - E2m$SER_8)
E2m <- mutate(E2m, "TSC_T" = 100 + E2m$SFR_T - E2m$SER_T)

print("TSC (Mean ± SEM) for WT Group Between Days 0-4")
(TSCm_WT_4 <- mean(WT1m$TSC_4, na.rm = TRUE))
(TSCs_WT_4 <- sd(WT1m$TSC_4, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(WT1m$TSC_4)))
print("TSC (Mean ± SEM) for E2 Group Between Days 0-4")
(TSCm_E2_4 <- mean(E2m$TSC_4, na.rm = TRUE))
(TSCs_E2_4 <- sd(E2m$TSC_4, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(E2m$TSC_4)))

print("TSC (Mean ± SEM) for WT Group Between Days 4-8")
(TSCm_WT_8 <- mean(WT1m$TSC_8, na.rm = TRUE))
(TSCs_WT_8 <- sd(WT1m$TSC_8, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(WT1m$TSC_8)))
print("TSC (Mean ± SEM) for E2 Group Between Days 4-8")
(TSCm_E2_8 <- mean(E2m$TSC_8, na.rm = TRUE))
(TSCs_E2_8 <- sd(E2m$TSC_8, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(E2m$TSC_8)))

print("TSC (Mean ± SEM) for WT Group Between Days 0-8")
(TSCm_WT_T <- mean(WT1m$TSC_T, na.rm = TRUE))
(TSCs_WT_T <- sd(WT1m$TSC_T, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(WT1m$TSC_T)))
print("TSC (Mean ± SEM) for E2 Group Between Days 0-8")
(TSCm_E2_T <- mean(E2m$TSC_T, na.rm = TRUE))
(TSCs_E2_T <- sd(E2m$TSC_T, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(E2m$TSC_T)))
```
This analysis perfectly matches what is described by the authors. They stated "a significant
increase in the total spine number in E2 implanted mice compared to that in control mice 
(Fig. 2C; total spine number during days 0–4: control, 96.5 ± 0.9%; E2, 100.0 ± 0.5%; total
spine number during days 0–8: control, 93.6 ± 1.5%; E2, 98.9 ± 1.2%)". During days 0-4, I
found an average TSC of 96.47 ± 0.87% in the WT1 group and 99.98% ± 0.51% for the E2 group.
From days 0-8, I reported an average TSC of 93.59 ± 1.49% and 98.87 ± 1.16% for the WT1 and
E2 groups, respectively.

The final descriptive statistic test I will perform will be calculating the persistent newly
formed spine ratio (PNFS). This measures the percentage of newly formed spines (previously
determined as SFR) that remained and persisted during days 0-4 of the experiment. In our
data files, this information can be found under the variable **d4_nfs_pers**. As before,
I will first use the `mutate()` function and then calculate the average and standard error
of the mean.
```{r}
WT1m <- mutate(WT1m, "PNFS" = WT1m$d4_nfs_pers / WT1m$d4_form * 100)
print("PNFS (Mean ± SEM) for WT Group Between Days 0-4")
(PNFSm_WT <- mean(WT1m$PNFS, na.rm = TRUE))
(PNFSs_WT <- sd(WT1m$PNFS, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(WT1m$PNFS)))

E2m <- mutate(E2m, "PNFS" = E2m$d4_nfs_pers / E2m$d4_form * 100)
print("PNFS (Mean ± SEM) for E2 Group Between Days 0-4")
(PNFSm_E2 <- mean(E2m$PNFS, na.rm = TRUE))
(PNFSs_E2 <- sd(E2m$PNFS, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(length(E2m$PNFS)))
```
From these calculated results, we can see the values very closely match those reported by
the authors. In the manuscript, they state that "in the E2 exposure group, the persistent 
newly formed spine ratio is almost twice as high as that in the control group (Fig. 3C; 
control, 37.5 ± 9.0%; E2, 68.8 ± 3.9%)." I found that the PNFS was 37.50 ± 8.33% for the
control group and 68.85 ± 3.87% for the E2 group. 

All of the descriptive statistics calculated thus far make it seem like there is a potential
difference in dendritic spine characteristics between the WT1 and E2 groups. To determine
whether this is statistically significant, I will conduct a t-test on the spine formation
rate, total spine count, and persistent newly formed spine ratio using **_R_**.
``` {r}
print("Student's t-Test for Spine Formation Rate from Days 0-4")
t.test(WT1m$SFR_4, E2m$SFR_4, conf.level = 0.95)
print("Student's t-Test for Spine Formation Rate from Days 4-8")
t.test(WT1m$SFR_8, E2m$SFR_8, conf.level = 0.95)
print("Student's t-Test for Spine Formation Rate from Days 0-8")
t.test(WT1m$SFR_T, E2m$SFR_T, conf.level = 0.95)

print("Student's t-Test for Total Spine Count from Days 0-4")
t.test(WT1m$TSC_4, E2m$TSC_4, conf.level = 0.95)
print("Student's t-Test for Total Spine Count from Days 4-8")
t.test(WT1m$TSC_8, E2m$TSC_8, conf.level = 0.95)
print("Student's t-Test for Total Spine Count from Days 0-8")
t.test(WT1m$TSC_T, E2m$TSC_T, conf.level = 0.95)

print("Student's t-Test for Persistent Newly Formed Spine Ratio from Days 0-4")
t.test(WT1m$PNFS, E2m$PNFS, conf.level = 0.95)
```
When the authors performed a Student's t-test on their results for the spine formation rate
from days 0-4, they got a p-value of 0.034. Performing this same analysis in **_R_** led to 
a p-value of 0.03442, which is consistent with what the authors found. Next, the authors
calculated a p-value of 0.006 in comparing the total number of spines from days 0-4 and a
p-value of 0.024 from days 0-8. Once again, the results that I obtained by performing the
Student's t-test was identical to that in the paper. I attained a p-value of 0.006139
between days 0-4 and 0.02401 from days 0-8. Lastly, the authors noted a p-value of 0.016 in
comparing the persistent newly formed spine ratio from days 0-4. When I conducted this
analysis, I got a p-value of 0.01545 that is very similar to what the authors found. Since
all of these p-values are under the critical value of 0.05, then it can be stated that these
presented results are statistically significant.

My next goal is to recreate the three graphs from Figure 2 of their paper. This image 
investigates how E2 treatment affects dendritic spine turnover and density during days 0-4,
4-8, and 0-8. In order to create these graphs, I need to create a new data frame that
compiles all the values of SER, SFR, and TSC across the different experimental groups and
day range. The key function that I use for this is `unlist()`. 
```{r}
Exp_Group <- c(rep("WT", 21), rep("E2", 27))
Day <- c(rep("0-4", 7), rep("4-8", 7), rep("0-8", 7), 
         rep("0-4", 9), rep("4-8", 9), rep("0-8", 9))
SER <- unlist(c(WT1m$SER_4, WT1m$SER_8, WT1m$SER_T, 
                E2m$SER_4, E2m$SER_8, E2m$SER_T), use.names = FALSE)
SFR <- unlist(c(WT1m$SFR_4, WT1m$SFR_8, WT1m$SFR_T, 
                E2m$SFR_4, E2m$SFR_8, E2m$SFR_T), use.names = FALSE)
TSC <- unlist(c(WT1m$TSC_4, WT1m$TSC_8, WT1m$TSC_T, 
                E2m$TSC_4, E2m$TSC_8, E2m$TSC_T), use.names = FALSE)
Fig2_data <- data.frame(Exp_Group, Day, SER, SFR, TSC)
head(Fig2_data)
```
Now, I will create a function that determines the mean and standard error of the mean for
each of the variables that will be plotted. I will call this function `data_summary`. The
output after using this function will be stored in a new data frame (Fig2_###_datsum) that 
is specific to each of the three variables to be plotted (i.e., **SER**, **SFR**, and 
**TSC**). The package {ggplot2} will then be used to replicate the graphs in Figure 2 of the
paper. I will lay out each panel side-by-side for easy comparison between these graphs. 
``` {r}

data_summary <- function(data, varname, groupnames){
  require(plyr)
  summary_func <- function(x, col){

In observing these three pairs of images, my reanalysis of the authors' data appeared to be
successful and matched with Figure 2 of the manuscript.

## Discussion
In summary, I was able to successfully replicate the descriptive and inferential statistics
of Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the paper while also recreating Figure 2. The technique the 
authors used to calculate statistical significance in Figure 2 was a Student's t-test. The 
statistically significant differences between the WT1 and E2 groups in terms of SER, SFR, 
and TSC that I found were also consistent with what the authors reported. 

There were several limitations that I noticed in the authors' data. There were several 
missing values scattered across different groups that are unaccounted for in the paper. 
Typically, you would not include data points that you don't have complete data for, 
especially if no reason is given for this. The authors' also had a relatively low n count of
just 6 for the WT1 group, which can affect the power of their study. Additionally, when I 
was doing the exploratory data analyses, I noticed that there was a noticeable difference in
total dendritic spine count between the WT1 and WT2 groups, even though these animals were 
exposed to the same exact treatment condition. In fact, a t-test between these two wild-type
groups (performed below) had a p-value of 0.1608. This definitely warrants some explanation 
as to why this difference exists.
``` {r}
t.test(WT1$dT_total, WT2$dT_total)
```
I think that the authors could have performed a repeated measures ANOVA to determine whether
dendritic spine formation and elimination is also affected as a function of time post-E2 
treatment. I feel like performing other statistical tests in addition to a Student's t-test 
would help strengthen the paper and could lead to interesting discoveries.

Overall, I feel that working on this assignment has really helped strengthen my **_R_** 
skills. Given that this paper is in a similar research field that I am in, I can now see
myself being able to use **_R_** in my own research and data analysis. I found that the
trickiest parts of this data replication assignment was replicating the graphs in Figure 2.
This required some reorganization of the raw data file and creation of new data frames that 
I was unfamiliar with. I also learned a lot about many of the difficult functionalities of
{ggplot2} and what makes it such a versatile package.
